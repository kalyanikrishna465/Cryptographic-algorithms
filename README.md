##  Available Ciphers

Caesar Cipher - Simple substitution cipher that shifts letters by a fixed value<br>
Affine Cipher - Combines multiplication and addition in modular arithmetic<br>
Atbash Cipher - Substitution cipher that maps letters to their reverse position<br>
August Cipher - Fixed shift cipher (Caesar with shift=1)<br>
Autokey Cipher - Uses the message itself as part of the key<br>
Beaufort Cipher - Similar to Vigenère but subtracts plaintext from key<br>
Gronsfeld Cipher - Like Vigenère but uses digits instead of letters for the key<br>
Hill Cipher - Uses linear algebra to encrypt blocks of letters with a matrix key<br>
Myszkowski Cipher - Transposition cipher that arranges plaintext in a grid<br>
Playfair Cipher - Encrypts pairs of letters using a 5x5 grid<br>
Rail Fence Cipher - Transposition cipher using a zigzag pattern<br>
Route Cipher - Arranges plaintext in a grid and reads it in a spiral pattern<br>
Vigenère Cipher - Uses a keyword to determine shift values for each letter<br>
