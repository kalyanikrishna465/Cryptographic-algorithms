## Available Ciphers

| Cipher Name       | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| **Caesar Cipher** | Simple substitution cipher that shifts letters by a fixed value |
| **Affine Cipher** | Combines multiplication and addition in modular arithmetic |
| **Atbash Cipher** | Substitution cipher that maps letters to their reverse position |
| **August Cipher** | Fixed shift cipher (Caesar with shift=1) |
| **Autokey Cipher** | Uses the message itself as part of the key |
| **Beaufort Cipher** | Similar to Vigenère but subtracts plaintext from key |
| **Gronsfeld Cipher** | Like Vigenère but uses digits instead of letters for the key |
| **Hill Cipher** | Uses linear algebra to encrypt blocks of letters with a matrix key |
| **Myszkowski Cipher** | Transposition cipher that arranges plaintext in a grid |
| **Playfair Cipher** | Encrypts pairs of letters using a 5x5 grid |
| **Rail Fence Cipher** | Transposition cipher using a zigzag pattern |
| **Route Cipher** | Arranges plaintext in a grid and reads it in a spiral pattern |
| **Vigenère Cipher** | Uses a keyword to determine shift values for each letter |
